// This is a question to to practice using the test command. Below is a function that should sum 2 numbers

// Try running `npm run test` The test framework will output the results of all the tests along with some helpful messages
// currently this function is failing to pass its test. Fix it and run the tests again.

function sum(a, b) {
}

module.exports = sum; // the test framework relies on the correct export. Every question will already export the correct value so make sure you don't edit it.
